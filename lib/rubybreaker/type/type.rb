# This file contains the type structure used in RubyBreaker. Here we list 
# types that are used (allowed) in RubyBreaker:
# 
#   AnyType          represents basically any type in Ruby
#   NilType          represents a nil object
#   SelfType         represents "self"--the current object
#   NominalType      represents an object 
#   DuckType         represents a partial object (a collection of methods)
#   FusionType       represents an object along with a set of methods
#   MethodType       represents a method
#   BlockType        represents a block
#   OrType           represents one of the many objects (i.e, OR)
#   OptionalType     represents an optional argument type
#   VarLengthType    represents a variable length argument type
#   MethodListType   represents one or more methods
