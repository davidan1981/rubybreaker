# This file contains the default type system for RubyBreaker. It uses
# subtyping defined in ../typing/subtyping.rb. It is not a constraint-based
# type system and does not check type errors statically. The main purpose of
# this type system is to give a readable type signature to every method in
# designated modules and classes.

      # This method computes the least upper bound of the existing method
      # type and newly observed argument/block/return types. There are a few
      # cases to consider:
      #
      # If the existing type is a method list type, the new observed type
      # will be either "consolidated" into one of the method types in the
      # list or added to the list.
      #
      # If there is no compatibility between the existing method type and
      # the observed type, then the method type will be promoted to a method
      # list type. And the newly observed type will be added to the list.
      #
      # For each method type,
      #
      # It basically consolidates the existing type information for the
      # invoked method and the observed type.
      #
      # For arguments, we look for most general type that can handle all
      # types we have seen. This means we find the super type of all types
      # we have seen (excluding unknown types).
      # 
      # For return, we look for most specific type that can handle both
      # types.  Therefore, if two types have no subtype relation, we AND
      # them. But we do not allow AND types in the return type. We must turn
      # the method type to a method list type.
