# About

RubyBreaker has its root in Rubydust (which stands for Ruby Dynamic
Unraveling of Static Types), an academic research project designed and
implemented at University of Maryland. However, unlike Rubydust,
RubyBreaker aims to be a practical documentation tool for Ruby rather than a
full-scale type inference tool.  Although it is certainly possible that
RubyBreaker evolves into something more solid in its type system, the
primary goal of this project is to help Ruby programmers practically as much
as possible.

## Acknowledgment

The term, "Fusion Type," is first coined by Professor Michael W. Hicks at
University of Maryland and represents an object using a structural type with
respect to a nominal type.
