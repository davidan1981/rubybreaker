# About

RubyBreaker has its root in Rubydust (which stands for Ruby Dynamic
Unraveling of Static Types), an academic research project designed and
implemented by David An, Avik Chaudhuri, Jeffrey S. Foster, and Michael W.
Hicks. However, unlike Rubydust, RubyBreaker aims to be a practical
documentation tool for Ruby rather than a full-scale type inference tool.
Although it is certainly possible that RubyBreaker evolves into something
more solid in its type system, the primary goal of this project is to help
Ruby programmers practically as much as possible.

## Acknowledgment

The term, "Fusion Type," is first coined by Professor Michael W. Hicks at
University of Maryland and represents an object using a structural type with
respect to a nominal type.
