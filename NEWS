# VERSION 0.0.2 

## Class Method Support

RubyBreaker now supports class methods.  Auto-documentation of class methods
is done in the eigen class scope of the target module. For example, the
consider the following:

  class A
    include RubyBreaker::Breakable
    class << self
      def foo(x); x.to_s end
    end
  end
  RubyBreaker.monitor()
  A.foo(1)

When `foo` method is run, RubyBreaker will auto-document the type of the
method and output as the following:

  class A
    include RubyBreaker::Broken
    class << self
      typesig("foo(fixnum[to_s]) -> string")
    end
  end
