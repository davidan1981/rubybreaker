# Introduction

RubyBreaker is an automatic type documentation tool written in pure Ruby. It
provides the framework for dynamically instrumenting a Ruby program to
monitor objects during the execution and document the observed type
information. In addition, it can perform early dynamic type checking.
In other words, RubyBreaker helps Ruby programs "break" out of the obscurity
and wildness by documenting the type information.  The type documentation
generated by RubyBreaker is also an executable Ruby code that can be used as
an input to subsequent analyses.  

The primary goal of RubyBreaker is to assign a type signature to every
method in selected modules and classes. A type signature is written in the
RubyBreaker Type Annotation Language which resembles the documentation style
used in Ruby Core Library Doc. No manual code change is required.  Overall,
this tool should help Ruby programmers document their code more rigorously
and effectively.

Currently, RubyBreaker *does not*

* Auto-document block arguments (inherent)
* Support parametric polymorphic types
* Support RDoc or YARD output format

To contribute to the project, visit RubyBreaker's
[GitHub page](http://github.com/rockalizer/rubybreaker) and 
[RubyGems page](http://rubygems.org/gems/rubybreaker). The web version of

## Requirements

Ruby 1.9.x and TreeTop 1.x

If the most recent Ruby 1.9 is installed on the computer, it will probably
work. If TreeTop is not installed, use RubyGems or download from the
following URL: [TreeTop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/)

## Installation

It is as simple as running the following command:

    $ gem install rubybreaker
