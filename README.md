# Introduction

RubyBreaker is a dynamic type documentation tool written in pure Ruby. It
provides the framework for dynamically instrumenting a Ruby program to
monitor objects during the execution and document the observed type
information. In other words, RubyBreaker "breaks" Ruby code out of its
obscurity and wildness (as in "code breaking" or "horse breaking") by
auto-documenting type information. The type documentation generated by
RubyBreaker is also an executable Ruby code that can be used as an input to
subsequent analyses.  

The primary goal of RubyBreaker is to assign a type signature to every
method in selected modules and classes. A type signature is written in the
RubyBreaker Type Annotation Language which resembles the documentation style
used in Ruby Core Library Doc. Manual code change is _not_ required if
used in Rakefile and is kept minimal if otherwise.  Overall, this tool
should help Ruby programmers document their code more rigorously and
effectively.

Currently, RubyBreaker *cannot*

* Auto-document block arguments (inherent)
* Perform early dynamic type checks
* Support parametric polymorphic types
* Support RDoc or YARD output format

To contribute to the project, visit RubyBreaker's
[GitHub page](http://github.com/rockalizer/rubybreaker) and 
[RubyGems page](http://rubygems.org/gems/rubybreaker). RubyBreaker RDoc can
be found in [here](rdoc/index.html).

## Requirements

Ruby 1.9.x and TreeTop 1.x

If the most recent Ruby 1.9 is installed on the computer, it will probably
work. If TreeTop is not installed, use RubyGems or download from the
following URL: [TreeTop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/)

## Installation

It is as simple as running the following command:

    $ gem install rubybreaker
